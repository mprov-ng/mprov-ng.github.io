## mProv
mProv is an improvised provisioner.  It was born out of the need for a simple, easy to install, and easy to use way of keeping inventory of
a large number of machines.  mProv was build to be modular, though, so adding new functions to it should be as easy as coding them in python
and plugging them in.  <img src="assets/images/cursor_blink.gif" />
